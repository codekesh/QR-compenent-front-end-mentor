## My process
My process was simple as follows-
1. I created id and in that I created 2 "div" tags and one "h2" tag and gave all classes to all of the three.
2. In one <div> tag I insert image of QR-code and in second I wrote a paragraph which is Grayish Blue in color and in h2 tag I wrote a heading which is Dark Blue in color.
3. I created 2 CSS stylesheets for desktop design and mobile design respectively with given condition in style guide with the help of media queries.
4. In each stylesheets there is lot of CSS custom properties like padding, margin, colors, size adjustments, position adjustments, etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Layout
- Media Queries

### What I learned
I learned CSS custom properties and give beauty to siteand learned media queries also which give responsive website.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I am not comfortable with this CSS code that I used 'ID' here, but 'class' is better because class can be used with same name more than once. But I am not saying ID is bad, ID have unique function that if specific column has to be edit than ID comes in picture.
